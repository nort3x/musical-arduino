arduino will sing for you

this simple implementation will change frequancy of pwm pin by tweaking duty cycle from 137 hz up to Mhz
good for making function generators (rough and ugly square waves) but will do the job!

- or your can make it sing a song for your with the most intersting quality you can imagine :D
